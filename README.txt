[Chords]

 	Chords can be maj, min, aug, or dim with up to two extensions from 6-13 
 (5-13 on the second/ third) on all the obvious points (no b12 or #8 sorry!) 
 over any bass note. Exceptions are in place and will be output to limit
 malformed chord notation. Inversions are limited by number of notes in the 
 chord, so C:^^^ is invalid but C7:^^^ is valid. X (a number) will add a line 
 to the engine X times, and one layer of encapsulation has been tested and is 
 functioning. More could break the engine. Space before and after bars and X's 
 should be used or else stuff might break. Third extension might break.
 
	- (Ebmaj7/Ab:4^^^ | Gbmin6b5#13/E:7^^ | x 2) x 2
  
 [Groove]
 
 	Uppercase letters == rest, lowercase letters == notes. Possible values are 
 [seqhwSEQHW] for sixteenth, eight, quarter, half, and whole respectively. 
 Note values can be concatenated, but only of same case. A [:] denotes a chord 
 change and should be used accordingly. Repeats work on groove too and 
 should be used to match any repeats on chords! 
 
	- (qwwwwwh:q+e+s+eww: x 2) x 2
  
Number of chord changes and number of chords must be equal.
